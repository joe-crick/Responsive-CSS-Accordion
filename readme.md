CSS Only Components for Pure CSS

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/joe-crick/pure-css-components.git
```

### Prerequisites

The usual FE requirements:

 - node

### Installing

Once you've cloned the repo, install dependencies

```
yarn
```
or
```
npm i
```

### Running

To run the site, start up an http server that will serve the project's contents. If you don't have one,
[http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) is a good option. Navigate to the root of the 
project.

_NOTE:_ If you're using `http-server`, this will be `localhost:8080`.

## Built With

* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) - The CSS pre-processor used - though the LESS is pretty generic, and can easily be converted to SASS, or CSS
* [StealJS](https://stealjs.com/) - Dependency Loader

## Versioning

I use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
