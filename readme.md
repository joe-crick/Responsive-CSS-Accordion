CSS Only Components for Pure CSS

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/joe-crick/pure-css-components.git
```

### Installing

Once you've cloned the repo, install dependencies

```
yarn
```
or
```
npm i
```

## Building

To compile the CSS, run:

```js
npm run build
```

The compiled, minified CSS will be located in the `dist` folder.

### Running the Demo Site

The lib comes with a demo site you can run to see the components in action. To run the demo site, start up an http server 
that will serve the project's contents. If you don't have one, [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) 
is a good option. Navigate to the root of the project.

_NOTE:_ If you're using `http-server`, this will be `localhost:8080`.

## Built With

* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) - The CSS pre-processor used - though the LESS is pretty generic, and can easily be converted to SASS, or CSS
* [StealJS](https://stealjs.com/) - Dependency Loader
* [Pure.CSS](https://purecss.io) - Responsive CSS modules that you can use in every web project

## Versioning

I use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
